# My Wild-cloud Apps

This directory contains the definitions for _your_ wild-cloud apps. You can change them however you like. You should keep them all in git and make commits anytime you change something. Some `wild` commands will overwrite files in your app directory (like when you are updating apps, or updating your configuration) so you'll want to review any changes made to your files after using them using `git`.

## Usage

To list all available apps:

```bash
wild-cloud-app-list
```

To add a new app:

```bash
wild-cloud-add <app>
```

To install the app:

```bash
wild-cloud-install <app>
```

To update the app:

```bash
TBD
```
