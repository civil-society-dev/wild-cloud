# Wild Cloud

Welcome! So excited you're here!

_This project is massively in progress. It's not ready to be used yet (even though I am using it as I develop it). This is published publicly for transparency. If you want to help out, please get in touch._

## Why Build Your Own Cloud?

In a world where our digital lives are increasingly controlled by large corporations, having your own personal cloud puts you back in control:

- **Privacy**: Your data stays on your hardware, under your control
- **Ownership**: No subscription fees or sudden price increases
- **Freedom**: Run the apps you want, the way you want them
- **Learning**: Gain valuable skills in modern cloud technologies
- **Resilience**: Reduce reliance on third-party services that can disappear

## What is This Project?

This project provides a complete, production-ready Kubernetes infrastructure designed for personal use. It combines enterprise-grade technologies in an easy-to-deploy package, allowing you to:

- Host your own services like web apps, databases, and more
- Access services securely from anywhere with automatic HTTPS
- Keep some services private on your home network
- Deploy new applications with a single command
- Manage everything through a slick web dashboard
